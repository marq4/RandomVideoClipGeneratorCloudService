## Terminology

* List: the text document that the user (DJ) generates locally by running any of the available scripts (like Windows PowerShell), and then uploads to the webpage. 
* Crate: a user (DJ) account will always have at least one crate. A new account will be created with an empty default crate. A crate holds a list of videos. 
* Playlist: the XSPF (XML) text file that contains the information for the random video clips. The user generates and downloads it by pressing a single button on the webpage. When the playlist is available locally the user can double-click it to display the video clips on VLC media player. 
* VLC: free open-source video player for any OS.

* ELB: ALB for the ASG.
* SNS: sends me emails when ASG scales in/out. 
* Route53: what is the price for a domain? Domain to purchase: www.randomvideoclipgenerator.com.

## Instructions for myself (dev) to scp code to local repo:
1. cd /c/Marq/Documents_C/Career/Repo/RandomVideoClipGeneratorCloudService/RandomVideoClipGeneratorCloudService/
2. scp -i ../../../Cloud/AWS/SSHAccess.pem ubuntu@ec2-3-144-77-148.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:/var/www/rvcg/upload.php .

## Instructions for myself (dev) to generate a test list:
1. Copy the same 3 videos to another subfolder test_DATE and simply rename them.
2. Open PowerShell as Admin.
3. cd C:\Marq\Documents_C\Career\Repo\RandomVideoClipGeneratorCloudService\RandomVideoClipGeneratorCloudService
4. powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass -file C:\Marq\Documents_C\Career\Repo\RandomVideoClipGeneratorCloudService\RandomVideoClipGeneratorCloudService\GenerateList.ps1 -custom_subfolder "example_videos"
